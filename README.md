# Volcanic Vacations

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1

*Volcanic Vacations* is a fictional volcano adventure holiday site that offers fully guided trips to volcanoes and volcanic zones around the world.

The initial idea to produce this site for my Milestone Project 1 stems from my life long passion for all subjects related to our planet, such as volcanoes, earthquakes and the weather. This interest eventually led me to complete a 7 year remote learning degree in Geosciences with the Open University.

I have also travelled on a volcano holiday myself to Sicily with an existing volcano tour operator. Having booked through their website I thought it would be a challenge to see if I could produce a site of my own design.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that are required as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program with *The Code Institute*.
The essential requirements for this prject wre to produce a  static website with a minimum of three pages that is fully responsive from mobile up to large screen sizes, using HTML5 and CSS3.
